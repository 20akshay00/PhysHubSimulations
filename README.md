### Prototypes for ThePhysicsHub

This repo has the prototype versions of simulations that I worked on, before adding it to [ThePhysicsHub](https://github.com/openpsimu) project (which is no longer being developed). 

### Usage

To run the simulations, simply clone the repo, add the simulation script in the [index.html](index.html) file and open in a browser.
